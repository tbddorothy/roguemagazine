After completing her post-graduate degree in Social Psychology, she moved to Johannesburg to work in Advertising as a copy writer and stylist for 2 years until finally deciding to freelance full-time to focus on creative pursuits. She has worked with various institutions including Nedbank (for the nedbank cup 2018), Brutal Fruit (brave to love me campaign) and Multichoice and has featured in Magazines from Elle, Cosmopolitan, Bona, and Glamour. She has filmed a documentary available on YouTube with internationally acclaimed youth culture hub, i-D Magazine and has shot for Vogue for their VogueWorld 100 inspirational people for 2018/19. MTV base, Real Talk with Anele, among other features. She often speaks and writes on trans identity politics among other topics focused on social transformation and can be found in her spare-time obsessing over astrology, pop culture and people who have changed the world. Through this piece, The violence of not belonging, Glow addresses the intersecting violence that trans-women expeirence at both the hands of the men and cis-women alike. Too often those that seek peace in adopting their authentic selves are met with an unwarranted, yet entrenched, disdain for anything that deviates from their understanding. No matter how alike we may really be.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-4">Helen Aadnesgaard is a writer, activist, and angry feminist. From touring feminist squat houses to waging social media justice war, she’s trying to find her place in the world and is working towards pursuing further education in gender studies. Currently, Helen runs the Business Development for Quote This Woman+ an NGO dedicated to amplifying marginalised voices, and works as a freelance copywriter and social media specialist. Helen responded to the theme with two poems. The first, Being Heard, is a chaotic flurry of thoughts and scenes from her real life where her voice felt silenced—like no one could hear her. Let Me Know When You’re Home Safe was inspired by a late drive home where she saw a woman walking on the street alone and so desperately wanted her to get home safe. This poem is a plea for men in South Africa to let women get home safely, a message she hopes will be heard.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-white mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-4">Nina Erasmus is a multi-talented artist, currently residing in Johannesburg. She comes from a dance background and is slowly making her way into choreography within the film industry. Her most recent choreography project was for a Gender-Based Violence campaign to raise awareness and funds surrounding South Africa’s most pressing issue. She made a dance for a music video entitled #MyBodyStandUp, featuring artists; such as Lira and GoodLuck, amongst others. Nina believes there is something worth observing in the ‘happenstance’ spirit behind analogue collage. One would struggle to make a collage if you had an exact picture in your mind before you open a book or cut into the photograph. It hardly works if you try to bend the paper to your will. How it does feel, sometimes, is if you follow your intuition and put things together that you like, a sort of story comes together. You might try to begin to explain this to someone and it may come through as not much more than a three year old’s jibber. However, it makes sense to you. Point is, some story inside of you came to talk and took its form as cut out pictures stuck together. Something escapes and it sits in view, for others to see. Are you rid of it? Perhaps not. These are the stories that have escaped me. My gender forms a part of my experience of this world. This series is handpicked to create some harmony around this theme.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text pb-2 mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-4">Olwethu de Vos is a multidisciplinary artist and art curator based in Johannesburg. She is affiliated with the city’s respected artist community, August House, and her practice encompasses explorations into two- and three-dimensional artworks, adding glass sculptures and mixed media drawings to her output, amongst others. De Vos obtained a Bachelor’s Degree in Fine and Applied Arts from the Tshwane University of Technology in Pretoria, where she majored in Glass Blowing, Sculpture and Figure Studies. De Vos is the Co-Founder of The Blessing Ngobeni Art Prize and The For Sale Project Exhibition. Confronted with the cityscape of sprawling Johannesburg, De Vos’ work interrogates the vast intricacies of societal ideologies and theories surrounding post-humanism. In these works, Olwethu depicts the human body in its purest form, without the pre imposed societal ideologies. Observing how we differentiate ourselves from each other and the source of it. This body of work is both a reminder and a call to action, to outgrow the moral conditioning we’ve grown up with. The values and ideologies imposed on you as a child stay with you throughout your adult life, and very few individuals come to the realization that they can change or completely remove these.</p>

She is currently doing her Masters degree at Tshwane University of Technology. As a female, Muslim artist, Saarah aims to break the expectations that drives the patriarchal Islamic art community. This series of work, depicts costructed scenes which investigate the dichotomies that engine the gender dynamics in a South African Muslim society that revolves around the culture of gender-based-violence. By combining the religious embellishments in contrast with monsters in her work, Saarah seeks to reclaim the fragility and power, the good and evil, the beauty and ugly, and the trauma and healing for herself and for the collective.</p>
